# Database Managment with MySQL and Node.js

## Description:
In this week, you will dive into relational databases using MySQL and integrate it with Node.js using Sequelize. You will design a database schema for storing expense data, and user profiles. This will provide hands-on experience with database design, SQL queries, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries in Node.js.

## Requirements:
